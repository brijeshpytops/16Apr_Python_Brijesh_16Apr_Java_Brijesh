File handling in C refers to the process of creating, opening, reading, writing, and closing files. It allows a program to store data permanently on a storage device like a hard disk, which can be accessed later. C provides a standard library stdio.h which contains functions for file handling.

1.] create file:

#include<stdio.h>

void main(){
    FILE *f;

    f = fopen("sample.txt", "w");

    if (f != NULL ){
        printf("File created successfully");
    }

    fclose(f);

}

2.]Write data into the file:

#include<stdio.h>

void main(){
    FILE *f;
    char data[100];

    printf("Enter something...: ");
    fgets(data, sizeof(data), stdin);

    f = fopen("sample.txt", "w");

    if (f != NULL ){
        printf("File open successfully");
    }else{
        printf("File unable to open");
    }

    fprintf(f, "%s", data);


    fclose(f);

}

3.]Read data from the file

#include<stdio.h>

void main(){
    FILE *f;
    char data[100];

    f = fopen("sample.txt", "r");

    if (f != NULL ){
        printf("File open successfully");
    }else{
        printf("File unable to open");
    }

    fgets(data, sizeof(data), f);

    printf("DATA : %s", data);


    fclose(f);

}


4.] file delete 

#include<stdio.h>

void main(){
    char filename[] = "sample.txt";

    int res = remove(filename);

    if (res == 0){
        printf("File deleted successfuly.");
    }else{
        printf("File unable to delete.");
    }
}
